Chapter 3 - Selection
3.8. Self Test Questions

1. Explain the difference between sequence and selection.

	Sequence is when a progran runs through the code in sequence, meaning
	the instructions are executed line by line.
	Selection is implementing condition statements to control the flow,
	meaning lines of code are only executed if the condition is met.

2. When would it be appropriate to use:

- an if statement?
	when the program is required to make a choice. A condition is 
	created, and if the condition evaluates to true the code is
	executed.
	
- an if... else statement?

	This can be used when multiple choices need to be considered.
	Multiple conditions can be evaluated and code is executed in
	each case. Otherwise, the code is skipped.
	It also performs error checking, displaying a statement if none
	of the conditions are met.
	
- a switch statement?

	A switch statement is used in the same way as an if...else.
	However it presents the code in a compact and neater form.
	The syntax is different, using 
	switch (condition) { case : instruction }
	
3. Consider the following Java program, which is intended to display
the code of a cinema ticket. Part of the code has been replaced by a
comment. Replace the comment so that children under 14 get half price
tickets. (See class CinemaTicket).

4. Consider the following program:

public class Colours
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int x;
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
		x = keyboard.nextInt();
		if (x > 10) System.out.println("Green");
		System.out.println("Blue");
		System.out.println("Red");
	}
}

What would be the output from this program if
(a) the user entered 10 when prompted? 
	// Red
	// 10 is not greater than 10, so the condition is not met and
	// the code doesn't run.
	
(b) the user entered 20 when prompted?
	// Green
	// Blue
	// Red
	// 20 is greater than 10, so the condition is met and the code
	// runs, including the last instruction.
	
(c) the braces used in the if statement are removed, and the user
enters 10 when prompted?
	// Blue
	// Red
	// Because the braces are removed, only the first instruction is
	// considered as part of the if statement, meaning the second
	// instruction will be executed sequentially, followed by the last
	// instruction.
	
(d)	the braces used in the if statement are removed, and the user
enters 20 when prompted?
	// Green
	// Blue
	// Red
	// The first instruction in the if statement is executed, as
	// the condition is met, followed by the next two statements.
	

5. Consider the following program:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Colours2
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int x;
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
		x = keyboard.nextInt();
		if (x > 10)
		{
			System.out.println("Green");
		}
		else
		{
			System.out.println("Blue");
		}
		System.out.println("Red");
	}
}

What would be the output from this program if
(a) the user entered 10 when prompted?
	// Blue
	// Red

(b) the user entered 20 when prompted?
	// Green
	// Blue x
	// Red
	// Wrong! Blue would not print because 20 > 10, meaning the if
	// statement only prints out green. Blue would be printed out
	// only if the value was false, ie x is NOT greater than 10.
	
6. Consider the following program:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Colours3
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int x;
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter a number: ");
		x = keyboard.nextInt();
		switch (x)
		{
			case 1: case 2: System.out.println("Green"); break;
			case 3: case 4: case 5: System.out.println("Blue"); break;
			default: System.out.println("numbers 1-5 only");
		}
		System.out.println("Red");
	}
}

What would be the output from this program if
(a) the user entered 1 when prompted?
	// Green
	// Red
	
(b) the user entered 2 when prompted?
	// Green
	// Red
	
(c) the user entered 3 when prompted?
	// Blue
	// Red
	
(d)	the user entered 10 when prompted?
	// numbers 1-5 only
	// Red
	
(e) the break statements were removed from the switch statement and
the user entered 3 when prompted?
	// Blue
	// numbers 1 - 5 only ? not sure think NO
	// Red
	
(f) the default were removed from the switch statement and the user
entered 10 when prompted?
	// Red
