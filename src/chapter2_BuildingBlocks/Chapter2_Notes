The eight built-in primitive types of Java:
(also known as scalar types)

	byte		very small integers (whole numbers)
	short		small integers
	int			large integers
	long		very large integers
	
	float		small real numbers
	double		large real number (decimals)

	char		Unicode character set

	boolean		true or false
	
String (an object, not a primitive)

These data types are used to create named
locations in memory that will contain values
while the program is running. Also known as
variables, they are called variables as their
values vary over the life of the program.

Java convention dictates that:
variables start with a lowercase letter
classes start with an uppercase letter
pick a descriptive name for your variables

Declaring a variable in java:

	dataType variableName

		eg 	int number;
			char keyboardCharacter;
			double price;
			
Initialising a variable in java using the
assignment operator:

	variableName = value;
	// set the value of variableName to value
	// this puts the value into the box in
	// memory we called variableName
	
		eg 	number = 2;
			keyboardCharacter = 'a';
			price = 9.99;
			
Declaring and initialising in the same statement:

	int number = 2;
	char keyboardCharacter = 'a';
	double price = 9.99;
	
You cannot store a double value in an int variable
as this would result in information loss.
You can however store an int value in a double variable,
however you are essentially storing a small value
in a container too big for it!

A constant is essentially the same as a variable,
but the value does not change. 
They are declared using the keyword final, and
as per Java naming convention, constant names 
are UPPERCASE eg;

	final int HOURSINTHEDAY = 24;
	
Designing a program = considering how to build the software
Writing the code = implementation
To design a program, we use pseudocode, as below.
Each instruction demonstrates a well known programming concept.

	BEGIN
		DISPLAY program title
		DISPLAY prompt for price
		ENTER price
		DISPLAY prompt for tax
		ENTER tax
		SET price TO price * (1 + tax/100)
		DISPLAY new price
	END
