Chapter 6 - Arrays
6.11 Self-Test Questions

1. When is it appropriate to use an array in a program?

If you need to store data that is sequential, or of the same data type, it makes sense to
store this in a list, or array, rather than using multiple variables.

2. Consider the following explicit creation of an array:
	
	int[] someArray = {2,5,1,9,11};
	
(a) What would be the value of someArray.length?

	5, because there are 5 elements in the array

(b) What is the value of someArray[2]?
	
	1, because 1 is the 3 element in the array at position 2

(c) What would happen if you tried to access someArray[6]?

	You would get an exception error.

(d) Create the equivalent array by using the new operator and then assigning
the value of each element individually.

	int[] someArray = new int[5];
	
	someArray[0] = 2;
	someArray[1] = 5;
	someArray[2] = 1;
	someArray[3] = 9;
	someArray[4] = 11;

(e) Write a standard for loop that will double the value of every item in
someArray.

	for (int i = 0; i < someArray.length; i++)
	{
		System.out.println(someArray[i] * 2);
	} 

(f) Explain why, in this example, it would not be appropriate to use an
enhanced for loop.

	We cannot use an enhanced for loop here because we need the loop counter variable to
	access each element and modify it. Using the enhanced for loop does not modify the values
	within the array.

(g) Use an enhanced for loop to display the values inside the array.

	// don't forget the data type!!
	for (int item : someArray)
	{
		System.out.println(item);
	}

(h) Modify the enhanced for loop above so that only numbers greater than 2
are displayed.

	for (item : someArray)
	{
		if (item > 2)
		{
			System.out.println(item);
		}
	}

3. Look back at the program TemperatureReadings3 from Sect. 6.6, which
read in and displayed a series of temperature readings. Design and write the
code for an additional method, wasHot, which displays all days that recorded
temperatures of 18° or over.

	PSEUDOCODE for method wasHot
	
	BEGIN wasHot
		LOOP through array
			IF temperature > 18
				PRINT day
		END
	END
	
	static void wasHot(double[] arrayIn) // don't forget data type
	{
		for (int day = 0; day <= arrayIn.length; day++) // don't forget .length attribute
		{
			if (arrayIn[day] > 18)
			{
				System.out.println("Day" + (day + 1) "was hot");
			}
		}
	}
	
	Method call:
	wasHot(arrayIn);
		

4. Assume that an array has been declared in main as follows:

	int[] javaStudents;
	
This array is to be used to store a list of student exam marks. Now, for each of
the following methods, write the code for the given method and the instruction
in main to call this method:

(a) A method, enterExamMarks, that prompts the user to enter some exam
marks (as integers), stores the marks in an array and then returns this array.

	static int[] enterExamMarks()
	{
		int[] examMarksOut = new int[10];
		
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		for (int i = 0; i <= examMarksOut.length; i++)
		{
			System.out.println("Please enter exam mark for Student " + (i+1) + " : ";
			examMarksIn[i] = keyboard.nextInt();
		}
		
		return examMarksOut;
	}
	
	Method call in main:
	enterExamMarks();

(b) A method, increaseMarks, that accepts an array of exam marks and
increases each mark by 5.

	static void increaseMarks(int[] examMarksIn) // don't forget data type!
	{
		for(int i = 0; i < examMarksIn.length; i++) // always less than < the length
		{
			examMarksIn[i] = examMarksIn[i] + 5;
		}
	}
	
	Method call in main:
	increaseMarks(arrayIn);

(c) A method, allHavePassed, that accepts an array of exam marks and
returns true if all marks are greater than or equal to 40, and false
otherwise.

	static boolean allHavePassed(examMarksIn)
	{
		int sum = 0;
		
		for(int i = 0; i <= examMarksIn.length; i++)
		{
			sum = sum + examMarksIn[i];
		}
		
		return (sum / examMarksIn.length) >= 40;
	}

==============================================================================

5. 

(a) Describe the varargs feature of Java.

	Varargs is short for 'variable arguments'. It is represented by an ellipsis ...
	It enables methods to take a number of parameters from an array, or a specific selection
	rather than just a single array.
	Varargs implicitly converts the data received into an array within the method.
	** Each method can only have one varargs parameter
	** The varargs argument must be the last parameter

(b) Re-write the contains method below, from Sect. 6.8.5, to make use of
this varargs feature:

	// the [] is replaced with ... and the varargs must come last in the parameter list
	static boolean contains(int valueIn, int... arrayIn)
	{
		// enhanced 'for' loop used here 
		for (int currentElement : arrayIn)
		{
			if (currentElement == valueIn)
			{
				return true; // exit loop early if value found
			}
		}
		return false; // value not present
	}

(c) Give examples of different ways in which you could call this re-written
contains method now that you have used varargs.

I am uncertain how to call varargs, apart from in the very simply example which simply
turns the list of variables/values sent to the method into an array.

Eg:

	public class PlayingWithVarargs {
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			System.out.println("Display multiple arguments as an array");
			varargsMethod(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);
			
		}
		
		static void varargsMethod(int... valuesIn)
		{
			for (int item : valuesIn)
			{
				System.out.println(item);
			}
		}
	}

6. Consider the following array declaration, to store a collection of student grades.

	char [][] grades = new char[4][20];
	// This will create an array of 4 rows and 20 columns
	
Grades are recorded for 4 tutorial groups, and each tutorial group consists of 20
students.

(a) How many dimensions does this array have?

	It has 80 elements.

(b) What is the value of grades.length?

	4

(c) What is the value of grades[0].length?

	20
	
(d) Write the instruction to record the grade ‘B’ for the first student in the first
tutorial group.

	grades[0][0] = 'B';

7. Consider the following scenarios and, for each, declare the appropriate array:

(a) goals: an array to hold the number of goals each team in a league scores
in each game of a season. The league consist of 20 teams and a season
consists of 38 games.

	int[][] goals = new int[20][38];

(b) seats: an array to record whether or not a seat in a theatre is booked or not.
There are 70 rows of seats in the theatre and each row has 20 seats.

	int[][] seats = new int[70][20];

8. Consider the MonthlyTemperatures program of Sect. 6.9.4. Write an
additional method, max, that returns the maximum temperature recorded in the
given two-dimensional array.

Hint: look back at the algorithm for finding the maximum value in a onedimensional array in Sect. 6.8.1

	See program MonthlyTemperatures2 for the answer to this question.

9. Consider an application that records the punctuality of trains on a certain route.

	See program TrainData for the answer to this section.

(a) Declare a 2D array, late, to hold the number of times a train on this route
was late for each day of the week, and for each week of the year.

(b) Write a fragment of code that adds up the total number of days in the year
when a train was late more than twice in a given day.

10. A magic word square is a square in which a word can be formed by reading
each row and each column. For example, the following is a 4 by 4 magic word
square:

	‘P’ ‘R’ ‘E’ ‘Y’
	‘L’ ‘A’ ‘V’ ‘A’
	‘O’ ‘V’ ‘E’ ‘R’
	‘T’ ‘E’ ‘N’ ‘D’

(a) Declare and initialize a 2D array, magicSquare, to hold the words
illustrated above.

(b) Write a method, displayRow, that accepts the magicSquare array and
a row number and displays the word in that row.

(c) Write a method, displayColumn, that accepts the magicSquare array
and a column number and displays the word in that column.

	See program MagicWordSquare for the answers to this section.

11. 
(a) Distinguish between a regular 2D array and a ragged array.

	A regular 2D array has a neat number of columns, ie:
	
	int[][] regularArray = 	{
								{1, 2, 3, 4, 5},
								{2, 3, 4, 5, 7},
								{8, 5, 3, 2, 8}
							};
	
	A ragged array has an irregular number of columns, ie:
	
	int[][] raggedArray = 	{
								{1, 2, 3},
								{7, 4, 5, 2, 6, 9, 0},
								{2, 4}
							};

(b) Write instructions to create a ragged 2D array of integers, called triangle, that has the following form:
	(see page 175 in PDF doc for diagram)
	
	To create this ragged array, we will have to declare and initialise an array
	specifying only rows, as below:
	
	int[][] triangle = new triangle[4][];

(c) Write a fragment of code to find the largest number in the triangle
array.

	This will be the same as the syntax for finding the max number in previous programs;
		create method that takes in a 2D array
		declare & initialise variable to store max number
		loop through row
			loop through columns
				if the item is larger than the previously declared largest item, 
				assign to variable
		return variable
