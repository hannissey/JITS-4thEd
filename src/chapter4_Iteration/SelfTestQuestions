4.8 Self-Test Questions

1. Consider the following program:

	public class IterationQ1
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++)
			{
				System.out.println("YES");
			}
			System.out.println("OK");
		}
	}

(a) How many times does this for loop repeat?

	4

(b) What would be the output of this program?

The output would be:

	YES
	YES
	YES
	YES
	OK

2. Consider the following program:

	public class IterationQ2
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++)
			{
				System.out.println("YES");
				System.out.println("NO");
			}
			System.out.println("OK");
		}
	}
	
(a) How many times does this for loop repeat?

	3
	
(b) What would be the output of this program?

	YES
	NO
	YES
	NO
	YES
	NO
	OK
	
3. Consider the following program:

import java.util.Scanner;

	public class IterationQ3
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			int num;
			Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
			
			System.out.println("Enter a number: ");
			num = keyboard.nextInt();
			
			for (int i = 1; i < num; i++)
			{
				System.out.println("YES");
				System.out.println("NO");
			}
			System.out.println("OK");
		}
	}
	
(a) What would be the output of this program if the user entered 5 when prompted?

Counter begins at 1, so as long as i is less than 5, the loop will iterate resulting in:

	YES
	NO
	YES
	NO
	YES
	NO
	YES
	NO
	OK
	
(b) What would be the output of this program if the user entered 0 when prompted?

	The only output would be OK, as the loop will not run as 0 is less than 1.
	
4. Consider the following program:

	public class IterationQ4
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for (int i = 1; i <= 15; i = i + 2)
			{
				System.out.println(i);
			}
		}
	}

(a) How many times does this for loop repeat?

	The loop runs 8 times.
	
(b) What would be the output of this program?

	1
	3
	5
	7
	9
	11
	13
	15
	
(c) What would be the consequence of changing the test of the loop to i >= 15?

	The output would start from 15 and continue upwards, only displaying odd numbers.
	** Unable to check this, as program terminated without output or error **
	
5. Consider the following program:

	public class IterationQ5
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for (int i = 5; i >=2; i--)
			{
				switch (i)
				{
					case 1: case 3: System.out.println("YES"); break;
					case 2: case 4: System.out.println("NO");
				}
			}
			System.out.println("OK");
		}
	}
	
(a) How many times does this for loop repeat?

	4 x incorrect, 5 - 2 = 3 times
	
(b) What would be the output of this program?

	NO
	YES
	NO
	YES x incorrect. Case 1 is not printed as the counter finishes at 2
	OK
	
(c) What would be the consequence of changing the loop counter to (i++) instead of (i--)?

	There would be no output from the switch statement as there is no case for any number
	larger than 4, and the counter starts at 5.
	Only OK would be displayed.

6. What would be the output from the following program?
