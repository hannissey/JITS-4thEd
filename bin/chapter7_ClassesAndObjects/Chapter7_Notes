7.1 Introduction

Object-oriented programming languages (often known as OOP) are languages that use
classes and objects.
OOP consists of defining one or more classes that may interact with each other.

A class is a data type that can hold all types of information.
Instead of being restricted to a variable that can only hold a single piece of data, a class
can hold multiple pieces of data.

- A variable can hold a single piece of information.
- An array can hold multiple types of information of the same data type.
- A class can hold multiple pieces and types of information, including methods to manipulate
that information.

There are two aspects to a class:

- attibutes: the data that it holds
- methods: the tasks it can perform

A class is essentially the 'factory' from which 'objects' are created.
An object is an individual instance of a class.

A single program can have many classes, to enable us to create different objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------

7.4 The Oblong Class

(We will need to download the Oblong.java file from the JITS website later)

Once we have access the the Oblong class, we will be able to write declarations like this:

	Oblong myOblong;

We are declaring a new oblong called myOblong, using the Oblong class.
This creates a variable that holds a reference to an object, rather than the object itself.
No space has been allocated for myOblong, instead we have claimed a piece of memory for
myOblong to be stored.

When we create a class, this process is called instantiation.
To instantiate a object, we use a method of the class called a constructor.

The constructor is a method within a class that:
- always has the same name as the class
- reserves memory for the object to be created
- details what info is required for the object to be created

So say we want to create a new oblong.
First we can declare our new oblong, and create a memory address for the oblong:

	Oblong myOblong
	
Then, we create the object itself, by calling the constructor and giving it the info it needs.
In this case it is the height and length of the oblong, which is passed to the constructor as
below:

	myOblong = new Oblong(7.5, 12.5);

We can also, like with arrays, declare and initialise with one line of code:
	
	Oblong myOblong = new Oblong(7.5, 12.5);
	
Now whenever we wish to refer to our Oblong object, we can use myOblong.

We have been using the Scanner class to create a new object (keyboard) to read the user input:

	Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
	
This line calls the constructor, and sends in the parameter System.in.

Encapsulation is an important part of OOP. It protects the data by ensuring that the
attributes within the class cannot be accessed directly - they can only be interacted with
via the pre-defined methods.
We can only interact with a class via its methods, we do not need to know how the methods
work. This is another important aspect of encapsulation.

The only things we need to know to interact with a method are:
	- the method names
	- what the method does
	- what data the method needs
	- what data the method returns
	
A list of the method's inputs and outputs is referred to as the method's interface;
not to be confused with the user interface, that can be console applications or GUIs.
	
Referring back to creating the new oblong object using the constructor:

	Oblong myOblong = new Oblong(7.5, 12.5);
	
The Oblong class that has been created for us, but not yet revealed (to demonstrate
encapsulation) does have methods that enable us to set a new length and height, and then
return these values (display them on the screen).

So, say that we have created our new oblong, myOblong as above, but we set the height
incorrectly. We can use the setHeight method to correct this:

	myOblong.setheight(5.0);
	
This will then overwrite the initial height with the corrected height.
	
To call a method of an object, we use the object name, the dot operator and the method name
along with the new data:

	objectName.methodName(value);
	
When we have called methods previously when we were working within a single class, we
called methods like this:

	displayArray(someArray);
	poundsToKilos(pounds);
	
This is shorthand for:

	this.displayArray(someArray);
	this.poundsToKilos(pounds);
	
The keyword this tells your program the method you wish to use is present in the same class,
rather than another class.

As you progress, you will need to use the this keyword to tell your program in which class
the method is present.

When a object reference is first created, it is given a value of null.
A null value indicates there is no storage allocated.

	Oblong myOblong; // myOblong has a null value
	
-------------------------------------------------------------

7.6 Strings

String is a built-in class in Java that enables us to process strings, which unlike
primitive data-types such as int, char, etc, are sequences of characters.

Despite String being a class, Java lets us declare and intialise strings in the same way
as variables that hold primitive data-types:

	String name = "Charlie";
	
In actual fact, this is just shorthand for creating a String object, name, using the String
constructor, as below:

	String name = new String("Charlie");

The String class is the ONLY class that enables us to create a new object using the
assignment operator.

-------------------------------------------------------------

7.6 Obtaining Strings from the keyboard

* Refer to program StringTest.java for this section.

To get the user input for strings, we need to call the next() method of Scanner.
Recall that we use the Scanner methods below for different data types:

	int 	keyboard.nextInt();
	char 	keyboard.next().charAt(0);
	double  keyboard.nextDouble();
	String  keyboard.next();
	* See the table below for more String methods.
	
Be careful when using keyboard.next() and don't use whitespace in your strings.

Overloading/polymorphism

Overloading in Java comes from when elements with the same name are used for different
purposes. This is also known as polymorphism which means "different forms".

Notice we use the + operator for two distinct purposes in the program:

	concatenation	("Hello " + name);
	addition		(age + 1);

-------------------------------------------------------------

7.6.2 The Methods of the String Class

Below you will find some useful methods and how they work:

Method				Description								Inputs		Output	
________________________________________________________________________________

length				returns length of string				none		int
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
charAt				accepts integer and returns char at		int			char
					that position in the string
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
substring			accepts 2 integers (eg m and n) and 	two ints	String		
					returns a copy	of a chunk of the 
					string
					The chunk starts at m and ends at n-1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
concat				Accepts a new string, joins string to 	String		String
					another, and returns entire string
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
toUpperCase			returns copy of string in UPPERCASE		none		String
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
toLowerCase			returns copy of string in lowercase		none		String
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
compareTo			accepts an object (ie myString) and 	String		int
					compares it to the object's string. 
					It returns:
					- 0 if strings are identical
					- a negative number if string comes
					before myString in the alphabet
					- a positive number if the number
					comes afterwards
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
equals				accepts object and compares it to		String		boolean
					another object. Returns true if
					objects are identical, or false if
					not
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
equalsIgnoreCase	accepts a string and compares to		String		boolean
					original string. returns true if
					strings are identical (ignoring
					case) and false if they are not
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
startsWith			accepts a string and returns true if	String		boolean
					original string starts with that
					string, eg "hello world" starts with
					"h", "he", "hel" and so on
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
endsWith			accepts a string and returns true if	String		boolean
					original string ends with that
					string, eg "hello world" ends with
					"d", "ld", "rld" and so on		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
trim				returns a String object with any		None		String
					spaces (whitespace) removed		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-------------------------------------------------------------

7.6.3 Comparing Strings

When comparing two objects, such as Strings, we should use the equals method.

equals()

	To compare two strings, firstString and secondString, you would use the syntax below:
	
		if(firstString.equals(secondString))
		{
			// instructions here
		}
		
	A common mistake for programmers is to use the equality operator to compare strings,
	eg
	
		firstString == secondString;
		
	This will not cause a compilation error, but this will not do what you intend either.
	The above code simply finds out whether the objects have the same memory address. 
	It will not compare the value of string attributes of the objects.
	
compareTo()

		Remember that compareTo() returns an integer on whether an object comes
		before or after it in the alphabet. it will go through each letter until 
		finding a difference. If the strings are identical, it returns 0.
		
		Upper-case letters come before lowercase letters as their Unicode value is lower.
		So when using the compareTo() method and you input Strings Apple and apple, Apple
		will come before apple.
		
7.6.4 Entering Strings containing Spaces

When we use the next() method to process a String input by the user, there is an issue
where whitespace is considered the end of the input, so looking at the program below:

	Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
	System.out.println("Enter string: ");
	input = keyboard.next();

The user would input "Hello World", and only "Hello" would be assigned to variable input.
To process strings containing white space, the method nextLine() is necessary.

However, using nextLine() alongside nextInt or nextDouble in the same program, can cause
conflicts. This is due to using the same Scanner object to process all inputs - it is best
to create a unique Scanner object to only process Strings. See StringExample2 for an example.

7.7 Our Own Scanner Class for Keyboard Input

Issues can arise when using the Scanner class to obtain keyboard input from the user, ie

- we need to create a new Scanner object within every method
- there's no easy way to obtain a single character eg keyboard.next().charAt(0)
- using next() to get strings can cause issues due to whitespace

7.8 The Console Class

I have typed this out and saved it, however it does not work in the IDE as stated.
Will look into using console to do programming in future.

7.9 The BankAccount Class

We have the BankAccount.java file which contains the BankAccount class which will be looked
in more detail in the next chapter.

We don't need to know how it works just yet (due to encapsulation), however we do need to
know what the class requires in terms of data, and what methods it has.

The BankAccount class has these attributes:

	String = account number
	String = account name
	double = account balance
	
The methods are listed below:

Method				Description								Inputs		Output	
________________________________________________________________________________

BankAccount			the constructor							2 x 		n/a
															string
					accepts two strings and assigns them	objects
					to the account name & number.
					Also initialises balance to 0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
getAccountNumber	returns account number					none		String
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
getAccountName		returns account name					none		String
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
getBalance			returns balance							none		double
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
deposit				accepts a double data data type			double		none
					and adds to the balance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
withdraw			accepts a double, then uses an if		double		boolean
					statement to check if there is 
					enough to cover the amount.
					If false, the method terminates and
					returns false.
					If true, the method subtracts the
					double input from the balance and
					returns true.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.11 The ArrayList Class

Arrays can seem a bit clunky to work with. This is because arrays are a "low-level"*
construct and work in the same way as computers store items in memory. 
Programming languages make it easy for a programmer to code by providing what is known
as "higher level"** classes that reflect how we do things in real life, rather than how
computers process data.

* Remember that 'low level' in computing refers to machine or assembly language.
These are languages that, as humans, are hard to work with due to little or no abstraction.

** 'Higher level' languages are those that are closer to human language that machine 
language, therefore easier to work with and understand.

An example of higher level classes in Java are collection classes.
These allow programmers to deal with collections with methods in an easier way.
Collection classes are examples of generic classes.

When declaring a collection class we use the following syntax:

	ArrayList<BankAccount> accountList
	
	The type of object is in <>
	This results in accountList holding a list of BankAccount s
	
The full declaration is below:

	ArrayList<BankAccount> accountList = new ArrayList<>(); 
	
	The <> (diamond) is empty because we do not need to re-state the object type.
	The compiler uses type inference (so it reads the first part of the declaration
	and knows the new ArrayList<>() will hold <BankAccount>s
	
	ArrayLists are more flexible than arrays because they do not need to be initialised
	with a size, they are dynamic and expand & contract accordingly.

Compare this to how we declared our BankAccount object array:

	BankAccount[] accountList = new BankAccount[3];
	
When using ArrayList:

- we need to import the library: import java.util.ArrayList;
- we do not need to specify how many items will be in the list
- ArrayList can only hold objects, not primitive data types (for now!)
