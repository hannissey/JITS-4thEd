Chapter 4 - Iteration
4.8 Self-Test Questions

1. Consider the following program:

	public class IterationQ1
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++)
			{
				System.out.println("YES");
			}
			System.out.println("OK");
		}
	}

(a) How many times does this for loop repeat?

	4

(b) What would be the output of this program?

The output would be:

	YES
	YES
	YES
	YES
	OK

2. Consider the following program:

	public class IterationQ2
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++)
			{
				System.out.println("YES");
				System.out.println("NO");
			}
			System.out.println("OK");
		}
	}
	
(a) How many times does this for loop repeat?

	3
	
(b) What would be the output of this program?

	YES
	NO
	YES
	NO
	YES
	NO
	OK
	
3. Consider the following program:

import java.util.Scanner;

	public class IterationQ3
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			int num;
			Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
			
			System.out.println("Enter a number: ");
			num = keyboard.nextInt();
			
			for (int i = 1; i < num; i++)
			{
				System.out.println("YES");
				System.out.println("NO");
			}
			System.out.println("OK");
		}
	}
	
(a) What would be the output of this program if the user entered 5 when prompted?

Counter begins at 1, so as long as i is less than 5, the loop will iterate resulting in:

	YES
	NO
	YES
	NO
	YES
	NO
	YES
	NO
	OK
	
(b) What would be the output of this program if the user entered 0 when prompted?

	The only output would be OK, as the loop will not run as 0 is less than 1.
	
4. Consider the following program:

	public class IterationQ4
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for (int i = 1; i <= 15; i = i + 2)
			{
				System.out.println(i);
			}
		}
	}

(a) How many times does this for loop repeat?

	The loop runs 8 times.
	
(b) What would be the output of this program?

	1
	3
	5
	7
	9
	11
	13
	15
	
(c) What would be the consequence of changing the test of the loop to i >= 15?

	The output would start from 15 and continue upwards, only displaying odd numbers.
	** Unable to check this, as program terminated without output or error **
	
5. Consider the following program:

	public class IterationQ5
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for (int i = 5; i >=2; i--)
			{
				switch (i)
				{
					case 1: case 3: System.out.println("YES"); break;
					case 2: case 4: System.out.println("NO");
				}
			}
			System.out.println("OK");
		}
	}
	
(a) How many times does this for loop repeat?

	4 x incorrect, 5 - 2 = 3 times
	
(b) What would be the output of this program?

	NO
	YES
	NO
	YES x incorrect. Case 1 is not printed as the counter finishes at 2
	OK
	
(c) What would be the consequence of changing the loop counter to (i++) instead of (i--)?

	There would be no output from the switch statement as there is no case for any number
	larger than 4, and the counter starts at 5.
	Only OK would be displayed.

6. What would be the output from the following program?

	public class IterationQ6
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
			{
				for(int j = 1; j <= 7; j++)
				{
					System.out.print("*");
				}
				System.out.println();
			}
		}
	}
	
	The inner loop would normally run 7 times, however the outer loop only runs 3 times,
	so the output would be:
	
	*******
	*******
	*******
	
	Also note the use of 'print' which does not implement a line breaks whereas println()
	does (at the end).
	
7. Examine the program below that aims to allow a user to guess the square of a number
that is entered. Part of the code has been replaced by a comment:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class IterationQ7
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int num, square;
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter a number: ");
		num = keyboard.nextInt();
		System.out.print("Enter the square of this number: ");
		square = keyboard.nextInt();
		// loop to check answer
		while (// test to be completed);
		{
			System.out.println("Wrong answer, try again.");
			square = keyboard.nextInt();
		}
		System.out.println("Well done, right answer!");
	}
}

(a) Why is a while loop preferable to a for loop or a do...while loop here?

	We do not know how many iterations it will take for the user to get the answer right, and
	we only want this code to run if the answer is wrong. 
	A for loop is used for when we know how many times the loop needs to run, and a do...while
	loop is used for at least one iteration.

(b) Replace the comment with an appropriate test for this loop.

	square * square != num
	See program IterationQ7.
	
Q8. What would be the output of the following program?

	public class IterationQ8
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
			{
				if (i > 5)
				{
					break;
				}
				System.out.println(i);
			}
		}
	}
	
	The output would be:
	
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
	
9. What would be the output of the following program?

	public class IterationQ9
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
			{
				if (i <= 5)
				{
					continue;
				}
				System.out.println(i);
			}
		}
	}
	
	The output would be:
	
	6
	7
	8
	9
	10
